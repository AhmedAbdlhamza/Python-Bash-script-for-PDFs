# Python-Bash-script-for-PDFs
Here's a Python script ,It walks through all subfolders of the "test" directory, checks for a "Licenses" folder containing PDF files, and merges them into a single PDF file named after the project folder

In this example, we're assuming that the Python script is located in the "/home/user/scripts directory" and is named "merge_pdfs.py". We're also passing the parent directory as an argument to the Python script.

You'll need to modify the paths in the python command to match the location of your Python script. Once you've made the necessary modifications, you can save the "merge_pdfs.sh"
